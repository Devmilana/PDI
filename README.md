# Programming Design and Implementation

Part of my Software Engineering degree at Curtin University Colombo in 2023. 

This assignment has some of my first-ever code and it's definitely not my best work. My final mark was **79%**.

There’s no proper commit history because it wasn’t developed using GitHub.
